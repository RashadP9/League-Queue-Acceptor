# League-Queue-Acceptor


## Overview

The League Queue Acceptor is a tool designed to simplify the League of Legends (LoL) matchmaking process. 
It automates the process of accepting a queue when a match is found, eliminating the need to sit and wait until one is found.

This project is built using Python and leveraging the LCU (League Client Update) API to monitor the queue status and automatically accept once a match is found.
